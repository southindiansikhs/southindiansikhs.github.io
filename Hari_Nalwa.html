                                      Hari Singh Nalwa was a prominent military leader who served as the Commander-in-chief of the Sikh Khalsa Fauj, the army of the Sikh Empire. He played a vital role in conquering several territories, including Kasur, Sialkot, Attock, Multan, Kashmir, Peshawar, and Jamrud. Nalwa's leadership was instrumental in expanding the frontier of the Sikh Empire beyond the Indus River and securing it up to the mouth of the Khyber Pass. At the time of his death, the western boundary of the empire was Jamrud.

                                      In addition to his military accomplishments, Nalwa served as the governor of Kashmir, Peshawar, and Hazara. He established a mint on behalf of the Sikh Empire, which facilitated revenue collection in Kashmir and Peshawar. Overall, Hari Singh Nalwa played a significant role in the growth and consolidation of the Sikh Empire, both militarily and administratively.

                                    <h3>EARLY LIFE </h3>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                  
                                      Hari Singh Nalwa was born in Gujranwala, in the Majha region of Punjab to Dharam Kaur and Gurdial Singh Uppal. According to historian Autar Singh Sandhu, Hari Singh Nalwa's family belonged to the Uppal Khatri community. However, Vanit Nalwa, who claims to be Hari's descendant, states that their family originally belonged to Majitha town near Amritsar. After his father's death in 1798, he was raised by his mother. In 1801, at the age of ten, he underwent Amrit Sanchar and was initiated as a Khalsa. At the age of twelve, he began managing his father's estate and started learning horse riding.

                               <h3>MILITARY CAREER </h3>

                               
                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  During a hunting expedition in 1804, Hari Singh Nalwa was attacked by a tiger, which also killed his horse. Despite offers of help from his fellow hunters, he refused and reportedly killed the tiger single-handedly by tearing it apart from its mouth, earning the nickname Baghmar (Tiger-killer). It is unclear whether he had already joined the military at that time, but he was appointed as a Sardar, commanding 800 cavalry and infantry soldiers, in the same year.

                                <h3>BATTLE OF KASUR (1807) </h3>


                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                  In 1807, Hari Singh Nalwa played a significant role in the Sikh conquest of Kasur after assuming charge of an independent contingent. Kasur was a constant threat to the power of Maharaja Ranjit Singh due to its proximity to Lahore, the capital city. After three failed attempts, the city was finally captured in the fourth attack. Hari Singh Nalwa displayed remarkable bravery and skill during the campaign, earning him a Jagir as a recognition of his services. The campaign was led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Jodh Singh Ramgarhia.

                               <h3> BATTLE OF SIALKOT (1807)</h3>

                               
                               <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                Ranjit Singh assigned Hari Singh Nalwa to capture Sialkot from its ruler Jiwan Singh, which marked his first battle under independent command. The two armies battled for a couple of days, and ultimately, seventeen-year-old Hari Singh emerged victorious. He led the army to conquer the fort and hoisted the Sikh Flag on top of it.

                               <h3> BATTLE OF ATTOCK (1813)</h3>

                               
                               <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                The fort of Attock was a crucial replenishment point for all armies crossing the Indus River. In the early 19th century, Afghan officials appointed by the Kingdom of Kabul held this fort, as they did most of the territory along this frontier. The Sikhs, under the leadership of Dewan Mokham Chand, Maharaja Ranjit Singh's general, fought and won this battle against Wazir Fatteh Khan and his brother Dost Mohammad Khan, on behalf of Shah Mahmud of Kabul, on the banks of the Indus. Besides Hari Singh Nalwa, Hukam Singh Attariwala, Shyamu Singh, Khalsa Fateh Singh Ahluwalia, and Behmam Singh Malliawala actively participated in this battle. With the conquest of Attock, the adjoining regions of Hazara-i-Karlugh and Gandhgarh became tributary to the Sikhs. In 1815, Sherbaz Khan of Gandhgarh challenged Hari Singh Nalwa's authority and was defeated.

                             <h3> ABORTIVE ATTEMPT ON KASHMIR (1814)</h3>

                               
                             <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              After the conquest of Attock, the Sikhs attempted to take over Kashmir. Maharaja Ranjit Singh was the general in charge of the army, which was stationed at Rajauri. Ram Dayal, Dewan Mokham Chand's grandson, led the troops towards Srinagar, with Jamadar Khushal Singh leading the van, and Hari Singh Nalwa and Nihal Singh Attariwala bringing up the rear. However, the Sikhs were forced to retreat due to a lack of provisions, delayed reinforcements, bad weather, and treachery of their allies. In the following years, the Sikhs focused on subduing Muslim chiefs within the Kashmir territory, on their way to the Srinagar Valley. In 1815-16, Hari Singh Nalwa attacked and destroyed the stronghold of a treacherous Rajauri chief.

                            <h3>CONQUEST OF MAHMUDKOT (1816)</h3>

                               
                            <p style="text-align: justify;">
                              In preparation of the conquest of the strongly fortified Mankera, Maharaja Ranjit Singh decided to approach it from its southern extremity. After the Baisakhi of 1816, Misr Diwan Chand, Illahi Bakhsh, Fateh Singh Ahluwalia, Nihal Singh Attariwala and Hari Singh Nalwa accompanied by seven paltans and the topkhana went towards Mahmudkot. When news of its conquest arrived, it left the Maharaja so elated at the success of Sikh arms that he celebrated this victory with the firing of cannons. Two years later, on their way to Multan, the Sikhs captured the forts of Khangarh and Muzzaffargarh.

                           <h3>BATTLE OF MULTAN (1818)  </h3>

                               
                           <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In the winter of 1810, a victorious Sikh army was stationed near Multan in the Bari Doab region. They had recently conquered the Chuj Doab and took possession of the city of Multan with little resistance, but the fort remained a challenge. The Sikhs attempted to capture the fort by bombarding and mining it, but with little effect. During the siege, Sardar Nihal Singh Attariwala and Hari Singh Nalwa were seriously wounded, with Hari Singh suffering severe burns from a fire pot thrown from the fort's walls. He took several months to recover from his injuries. Ranjit Singh was disappointed by the length of the siege and was forced to abandon the attempt. Multan was eventually conquered under the nominal command of Kharak Singh and the actual command of Misr Diwan Chand, in a fiercely contested battle. Despite the exemplary courage of Muzzaffar Khan and his sons in defending the place, they were unable to withstand the Sikh onslaught. Hari Singh Nalwa played a significant role in the capture of the citadel.

                          <h3>PESHAWAR BECOMES TRIBUTARY (1818) </h3>

                               
                          <p style="text-align: justify;">
                            In August 1818, Shah Kamran, son of Shah Mahmud, killed their Barakzai Vazir Fateh Khan, which created chaos and confusion in the region. Taking advantage of this situation, the Sikhs crossed the Indus river and entered Peshawar, which was the summer capital of the Kingdom of Kabul (now part of modern-day Afghanistan). Following this, Hari Singh Nalwa was appointed to maintain the Sikh dominance in the region and to continue putting pressure on the local authorities.

                         <h3>MITHA TIWANA BECOMES HIS JAGIR (1818) </h3>

                               
                         <p style="text-align: justify;">
                          In early 1819, Hari Singh Nalwa accompanied Misr Diwan Chand to collect tribute from the Nawab of Mankera. After completing their mission, Diwan Chand crossed the Chenab River with his artillery and set up camp in Pindi Bhattian near Chiniot. Hari Singh was left behind to be stationed in the suburbs of Nurpur and Mitha Tiwana. Hari Singh must have been successful in his mission, as soon thereafter the Maharaja granted him all the possessions of the Tiwana chiefs in jagir.

                        <h3>KASHMIR BECOMES A PART OF THE PUNJAB (1819) </h3>

                               
                        <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        
                          In April of 1819, the Sikh army marched towards Kashmir, with Prince Kharak Singh holding nominal command. Misr Diwan Chand led the vanguard, while Hari Singh Nalwa brought up the rear to support the leading troops. The third division, under the personal command of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, expedited supplies and conveyed them to the advance troops. On the morning of July 5th, 1819, the Sikh columns advanced to the sound of bugles and a severe engagement took place between the two armies. The Sikhs emerged victorious and captured Kashmir, marking the end of five centuries of Muslim rule in the region. The Sikh camp and the cities of Lahore and Amritsar celebrated with great rejoicing and illumination for three successive nights. Two years later, as Governor of Kashmir, Hari Singh Nalwa put down the rebellion of the troublesome Khakha chief, Gulam Ali.

                       <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        During Afghan rule, the regions of Hazara-i-Karlugh, Gandhgarh, and Gakhar were governed from Attock, while Kashmir collected revenue from the upper regions of Pakhli, Damtaur, and Darband. The Sikhs attempted to collect revenue from Hazara-i-Karlugh, but they were unsuccessful and suffered the loss of prominent Sikh administrators and commanders. However, after the Sikh conquest of Kashmir, tribute was due from Pakhli, Damtaur, and Darband. When Hari Singh and his companions returned to the Punjab plains from Kashmir, they followed the traditional kafila route through Pakhli in an attempt to collect tribute from the region. Despite the usual fighting and resistance, the Sikh party was successful in their mission.

                        Hari Singh Nalwa achieved his most remarkable success in the Hazara region two years later. After completing his term as governor of Kashmir, he left the valley with 7,000 foot soldiers and crossed the Kishenganga River at Muzaffarabad. Despite the hazardous mountainous terrain, he and his entourage successfully reached Mangal. However, upon arrival, he found his path blocked by the chief of the Jaduns, who controlled the entire Damtaur region and had made Mangal their stronghold. Hari Singh requested permission to pass through their territory, but the Jaduns demanded a tax on all the Kashmiri goods and treasure he was carrying, as was customary for trade caravans. However, Hari Singh argued that the goods were not for trade purposes, but his claim was rejected. When negotiations failed, a battle ensued. After the conflict, Hari Singh left to join the Sikh army, which was preparing to attack Mankera. Before leaving, he collected a fine from every household and constructed a fort in the area.

                     <h3> BATTLE OF MANKERA (1822)</h3>

                               
                      <p style="text-align: justify;">
                        The Sindh Sagar Doab region was mainly governed from Mankera and Mitha Tiwana, with Nawab Hafiz Ahmed Khan, a relative of the Durranis, having considerable influence in the area. He commanded a vast area, protected by twelve forts, including Mankera. As the rule of the Afghans in Kabul weakened, the governors of Attock, Mankera, Mitha Tiwana, and Khushab declared their independence. In 1821, Maharaja Ranjit Singh celebrated Dussehra across the river Ravi at Shahdera and set his sights on this territory. As Governor of Kashmir, Hari Singh Nalwa was familiar with the region and was summoned to join the Lahore Army, which had already set out towards the river Indus. They met at Mitha Tiwana, and the offensive operations began in early November.<br><br>

                        The previous Nawab of Mankera, Nawab Mohammed Khan, had surrounded the area with a cordon of twelve forts, which the Sikh army soon occupied, leaving only Mankera to be conquered. The Tiwanas, now feudatories of Hari Singh Nalwa, were eager to return the favor to the Nawab for his previous active participation in the reduction of Mitha Tiwana. The force was divided into three parts, with Hari Singh commanding one column, and each column entered the Mankera territory by a different route, capturing various places en route. All three columns rejoined near Mankera town, and Mankera was besieged, with Nalwa's force being on the west of the fort.<br><br>
                        
                        The Nawab was allowed to proceed towards Dera Ismail Khan, which was granted to him as jagir. His descendants held the area until 1836.<br><br>

                     <h3> BATTLE OF NOWSHERA (NAUSHEHRA) (1823)</h3>

                               
                     <p style="text-align: justify;">
                      In 1818, the Sikhs made their first incursion into Peshawar, but did not occupy the area. They instead collected tribute from Yar Mohammed, the Barakzai governor. However, Azim Khan, Yar Mohammed's half-brother in Kabul, was displeased with the governor's deference to the Sikhs and marched with a large force to restore the honor of the Afghans and avenge the loss of Kashmir. Hari Singh Nalwa was the first to cross the Indus at Attock with 8,000 men, accompanied by Diwan Kirpa Ram and Khalsa Sher Singh, the teenage son of the Maharaja.<br><br>

                      The Afghan army was expected near Nowshera, on the banks of the Kabul river (Landai). Hari Singh's immediate plan was to capture the Yusafzai stronghold to the north of the Landai at Jehangira and the Khattak territory to the south at Akora Khattak. Jehangira was a fortified town with strong towers and the Afghan Yusafzais put up a fierce resistance. However, Hari Singh managed to enter the fort and set up his thana there. The remaining troops then returned to their base camp at Akora after crossing the Landai river.<br><br>
                      
                      Mohammed Azim Khan had set up his camp roughly ten miles northwest of Hari Singh's position, on the right bank of the Landai river, facing the town of Nowshera, awaiting Ranjit Singh's approach. The Sikhs had planned two battles, one along each bank of the Landai. After Hari Singh had successfully subdued the Afghan tribal strongholds on either side of the river, Ranjit Singh left the fort of Attock, crossed the Landai river at a ford below Akora, and set up his camp near the fort of Jehangira. The renowned army commander Akali Phula Singh and Gurkha commander Bal Bahadur, along with their respective troops, accompanied the Maharaja. The Afghan Barakzais watched the battle from across the river but were unable to cross the Landai river. Eventually, the Afghan army withdrew from the area toward Jalalabad, the inheritors of Ahmed Shah Abdali's legacy.<br><br>

                    <h3> BATTLE OF SIRIKOT (1824)</h3>

                               
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                      Sirikot was a Mashwani village strategically located less than ten miles to the northwest of Haripur. It was situated in a basin at the northeastern end of the Gandhgarh Range, which made it a secure location and a haven for rebellious chiefs in the entire region. Hari Singh Nalwa headed towards Sirikot before the rains of 1824, but it took another six months before the attempt produced conclusive results. During this expedition, the Sardar almost lost his life.<br><br>

                        In the winter of 1824, Ranjit Singh's military campaign was scheduled towards Peshawar and Kabul. While stationed at Wazirabad, he received a written petition (arzi) from Sardar Hari Singh, informing him that he and his men were overwhelmingly outnumbered, with one Sikh to ten Afghans. Ranjit Singh marched to Rohtas, then to Rawalpindi and finally via Sarai Kala, reached Sirikot. Upon hearing news of the Sikh army's approach, the Afghans withdrew.<br><br>

                   <p style="text-align: justify;">
                    Sayyid Ahmad, despite being a 'Hindki', was accepted as a leader by the Yusafzais, whom he came to redeem. Meanwhile, Budh Singh Sandhanwalia, along with 4,000 horsemen, was sent to Attock to assist in suppressing the Yusafzai rebellion. Afterward, Budh Singh learned of the Sayyid's presence when he had already crossed the Indus and camped near the fort of Khairabad. Ranjit Singh was still recovering when he received news of the Sayyid's arrival, leading a large force of Yusafzai peasants. The Maharaja recalled the gallantry of the Yusafzai defense in the Battle of Nowshera, and immediately mobilized his forces, dispatching them to the frontier.<br><br>

                    The Barakzais, who claimed loyalty to the Sikhs, were actually collaborating with other Afghans in Peshawar. The Sayyid led his forces from Peshawar towards Nowshera, prompting Sardar Budh Singh to request clarification of his intentions. The Sayyid responded that he aimed to capture the Attock fort before engaging Budh Singh in battle.<br><br>
                    
                    Hari Singh Nalwa guarded the Attock fort to prevent the Sayyid and his troops from crossing the river until reinforcements arrived from Lahore. The Sikhs received intelligence that the jihadis accompanying the Sayyid numbered several thousand. The battle between the Sayyid and the Sikhs took place on 14 Phagun (23 February) 1827, beginning around ten in the morning.<br><br>
                    
                    The opposing forces both proclaimed the greatness of God Almighty, albeit in different languages, before commencing the slaughter. The cannonade lasted for about two hours. The Sikhs charged at their opponents, routing them and pursuing them victoriously for six miles, seizing their guns, swivels, and camp equipment. The casualty count was around 150,000.<br><br>

                 <h3> DOST MOHAMMAD KHAN WITHDRAWS (1835)</h3>

                               
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">
                 
                  Hari Singh Nalwa was serving as the governor of Peshawar when Dost Mohammed led a large force to challenge the Sikhs. After his victory against Shah Shuja in the first quarter of 1835, Dost Mohammed declared himself the Padshah (king) and called for a Jihad, setting off from Kabul to wrest Peshawar from the Sikhs. However, Ranjit Singh, the Sikh leader, directed his generals to keep the Afghans engaged in negotiations and to win over Sultan Mohammed Khan. He also instructed them not to enter into a general engagement until his arrival, even if attacked.<br><br>

                  Despite these orders, Hari Singh Nalwa and other Sikh chieftains requested Ranjit Singh to allow them to engage with the Afghans. On 10 May 1835, a group including Sardar Hari Singh, Raja Gulab Singh, Misr Sukh Raj, Sardar Attar Singh Sandhanwalia, Jamadar Khushal Singh, the Raja Kalan (Dhian Singh), Monsieur Court, Signor Avitabile, Sardar Tej Singh, Dhaunkal Singh, Illahi Bakhsh of the topkhana, Sardar Jawala Singh, and Sardar Lehna Singh Majithia were ordered to move. The troops formed a semicircle in front of the Amir's encampment over five kos, and Sardar Hari Singh proposed to dam the water of the stream Bara, which flowed in the direction of Dost Mohammed Khan's camp. When the Ghazis appeared, Sardar Hari Singh fired his guns, but the Maharaja ordered him to avoid battle and sent his Vakils to negotiate with the Amir.<br><br>

                  Dost Mohammed Khan was assured that the Sikhs would effect a truce until their Vakils were in his camp, but he accused Fakir Aziz-ud-din of using "much language, having plenty of leaves but little fruit." When Dost Mohammed found that both his step-brothers, Jabbar and Sultan, were irredeemably lost to him, he decided to retire from the field with his entire army, armament, and equipment. He left at night and made sure that the Fakir did not return to the Sikh camp until after he had gone through the Khyber Pass.<br><br>

                <h3> JAMRUD (KHYBER PASS) (1836)</h3>

                               
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  In October 1836, after the Dussehra celebrations in Amritsar, Hari Singh Nalwa launched a surprise attack on the village of Jamrud, located at the entrance of the Khyber Pass. The Misha Khel Khyberis, who owned the village, were notorious for their exceptional marksmanship and disregard for authority. Hari Singh Nalwa had previously encountered this tribe after the Battle of Nowshera when he pursued the fleeing Azim Khan and again when he chased Dost Mohammed Khan in 1835.<br><br>

                  The capture of Jamrud was fiercely contested, but it seemed that the village was taken off guard. Once captured, Hari Singh Nalwa immediately ordered the fortification of the position. The existing small fort was quickly repaired. The news of this event was swiftly transmitted to Kabul, and Masson informed Wade of the developments on this frontier in a letter dated 31 October 1836. With the conquest of Jamrud, which was situated at the entrance of the Khyber Pass, the Sikh Empire's frontier now bordered the foothills of the Hindu Kush Mountains.<br><br>

                 <p style="text-align: justify;">
                
                  The Khyberis' defeat had a profound impact on the Afghans. In the company of Kanwar Sher Singh, Hari Singh Nalwa advanced towards the Yusafzai strongholds in the northeast of Peshawar, which had refused to pay tribute for three years. The Sikhs vanquished the Yusafzais, and their leader, Fateh Khan of Panjtar, lost his territory. According to reports, 15,000 mulkia fled before the Sikhs, with many being killed and the rest seeking refuge in the hills. After burning and razing Panjtar to the ground, Hari Singh returned to Peshawar and collected all the outstanding revenue. Fateh Khan was compelled to sign an agreement to pay tribute, after which Panjtar was released. When news of the conquest of Panjtar reached the Court of Lahore, a fireworks display was suggested.

                <h3> BATTLE OF JAMRUD (1837) </h3>

                               
                 <p style="text-align: justify;">
                
                  In March 1837, the grandson of the Maharaja, Nau Nihal Singh, was getting married, and troops were withdrawn from various parts of the Punjab to show strength for the British Commander-in-Chief who was invited to the wedding. Dost Mohammed Khan was also invited to the event, but he had other plans. He ordered his army to march towards Jamrud with the aim of taking the forts of Shabqadar, Jamrud, and Peshawar. Hari Singh Nalwa was supposed to be in Amritsar for the wedding, but he was actually in Peshawar, possibly due to illness.<br><br>

                  Hari Singh was instructed not to engage with the Afghans until reinforcements arrived from Lahore. Mahan Singh, his lieutenant, was in the fortress of Jamrud with limited supplies and 600 men when the Afghan forces surrounded them from all sides. Although the Sikhs were outnumbered, Hari Singh's presence caused panic in the Afghan army. In the ensuing melee, Hari Singh Nalwa was gravely wounded. He instructed his lieutenant not to let news of his death out until reinforcements arrived, and that's what happened. The Afghans knew that Hari Singh had been wounded, but they waited for over a week until the news of his death was confirmed. They withdrew after seeing his body hung outside the fort.<br><br>

                  Hari Singh Nalwa's death was a significant loss for the Sikhs. He had not only defended Jamrud and Peshawar, but he had also prevented the Afghans from ravaging the entire north-west frontier. The victories over the Afghans were a favourite topic of conversation for Ranjit Singh, who ordered a shawl from Kashmir at the record price of Rs 5000, depicting scenes of the battles fought with them.<br><br>

                  Following Hari Singh Nalwa's death, no further conquests were made in that direction, and the Khyber Pass remained the Sikh frontier until the annexation of the Punjab by the British.<br><br>

                  In 1831, Hari Singh was deputed to head a diplomatic mission to Lord William Bentinck, Governor-General of British India. The Ropar Meeting between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the head of British India followed soon thereafter. The British desired to persuade Ranjit Singh to open the Indus for trade. Hari Singh Nalwa expressed strong reservations against any such move. The most compelling reason for the Sardar’s scepticism was the scenario visible across the Satluj — namely, the proceedings in British Hindustan. As a “wide awake” military man and an efficient administrator, Hari Singh Nalwa clearly understood both the military and trade designs of the British.

                <h3> ACTIVISM</h3>

                               
                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                  Hari Singh served as a commander in the regiment during Maharaja Ranjit Singh's attack on Kasur in 1807, where he displayed remarkable military skills. As a reward, he was granted a valuable "jagir". He also took part in various military expeditions, including those in Sialkot, Sahival, and Khushab, and fought in four of the seven campaigns against Multan led by Ranjit Singh between 1810 and 1818. In the battle of Attock in 1813, he served as the second-in-command to Diwan Mohkam Chand, and fought in Kashmir in 1814 and 1819.<br><br>

                  After the Sikh conquest of Kashmir, Hari Singh was appointed as its governor in 1820, replacing Diwan Moti Ram. He undertook several measures to establish civil order in the region, including dividing the territory into parganahs, with each under a collector. He also suppressed robbers in the forests, bound habitual criminals, and constructed forts in Uri and Muzaffarabad. Additionally, he initiated the construction of gurudwaras at Matan and Baramulla and started work on a spacious garden on the bank of the River Jhelum.<br><br>
                  
                  In the aftermath of the devastating floods of 1821, Hari Singh took steps to provide immediate relief to the affected population. As a special favor from Maharaja Ranjit Singh, he was allowed to mint coins in his own name, known as the Hari Singhji rupee, which continued to be in circulation in the valley till the late 19th century.<br><br>
                  
                  In 1822, Hari Singh was posted to the Pathan territory of Hazara on the northwest border of the Sikh kingdom, where he spent fifteen years settling the troubled area. He constructed a robust fort near Salik Serai, named Harikishangarh after the Eighth Guru, and raised a town in its vicinity, which later developed into a thriving commercial and trade center, known as Haripur.<br><br>
                  
                  From 1827 to 1831, he was involved in repelling Sayyid Ahmad Barelavi's fierce campaign against the Sikhs.<br><br>

                  In 1834, Hari Singh finally captured Peshawar and added it to the Sikh territories. Two years later, he erected a fort at Jamrud, located at the entrance of the Khyber Pass, which made it impossible for invaders from the northwest to penetrate through the pass.<br><br>
                  
                  On 30 April 1837, during a fierce battle against the Afghans led by Akbar Khan, Hari Singh sustained four gunshot wounds and two sabre cuts across his chest. Despite his injuries, he continued to issue orders until he received another gunshot wound in his side. He summoned all his remaining strength for the last time and managed to ride to his field tent, from where he was later transported to the fort. The great general passed away that same evening. In his last instructions, he requested that his death should not be made public until the arrival of the Maharaja's relief column.<br><br>

                  In 1881, British newspapers compared several great generals from history and came to the following conclusion:<br><br>

                  "Some people might consider Napoleon a great general. Others may name Marshal Hindenburg, Lord Kitchener, General Karobzey, or the Duke of Wellington, among others. Some may even go so far as to mention Hulagu Khan, Genghis Khan, Chingiz Khan, Richard the Lionheart, or Alauddin Khilji. However, let me tell you that in North India, there was a general by the name of Hari Singh Nalwa of the Sikhs, who was superior to them all. If he had lived longer and had access to the resources and artillery of the British, he would have conquered most of Asia and Europe."<br><br>

               <p style="text-align: justify;">
                Hari Singh Nalwa, known as the lion-ripper, was waiting for his visitor, who was none other than Baron Charles Hugh. The Baron was not a typical European anthropologist or diplomat but an accomplished explorer and traveler. Having already researched his subject, he surprised Hari Singh by recounting the legend that had led to his feared nickname. According to the legend, Hari Singh had cleaved the head of a tiger that had already seized him as prey. Impressed by the Baron's knowledge, Hari Singh gifted him with a portrait of the incident and subtly asked for information about European states.<br><br>

                The Baron was aware of the subtlety in Hari Singh's request and later concluded that their conversation was different from the majority of such interviews in India. It consisted of an exchange of ideas and references to events that had actually taken place.<br><br>

              When Hari Singh was only 14 years old, he had the opportunity to accompany the Maharaja on a hunt. While they were in the forest, a lion suddenly attacked him and threw him to the ground. Hari Singh was caught off guard and didn't have time to draw his sword. However, he managed to grab the lion's jaw and throw it away with great force. He then drew his sword and with one blow, severed the lion's head. The Maharaja and his courtiers were amazed by this incredible feat. As a result, the Maharaja gave him the name "Nalwa," which means "like Nall" in reference to a brave king known for hunting lions and other dangerous animals with his bare hands.

              According to Baron Hugel, a European traveler who wrote about his experiences in Kashmir and the Punjab, he surprised Hari Singh by knowing the story behind his name and his feat of killing the tiger that had attacked him. Hari Singh then gave him a portrait of himself in the act of killing the beast, and the conversation between them consisted of a genuine exchange of ideas and references to real events, which was uncommon for interviews in India at the time.

                Hari Singh Nalwa Sahib sustained severe injuries while battling against the forces of Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan. Unfortunately, he succumbed to his wounds and passed away. He was cremated at the Jamrud Fort, which was constructed at the entrance of the Khyber Pass in the region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. In 1892, Babu Gajju Mall Kapur, a Hindu resident of Peshawar, erected a monument in the fort as a tribute to Hari Singh Nalwa's memory.

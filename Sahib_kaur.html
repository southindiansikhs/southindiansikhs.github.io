                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    
                                      Bibi Sahib Kaur  was a notable leader and warrior who played a significant role in the history of the Sutlej states from 1793 to 1801. She was the elder sister of Raja Sahib Singh of Patiala and was married at an early age to Jaimal Singh of the Kanhaiya clan, who lived in Fatehgarh and controlled a large part of the Bari Doab above Dina Nagar in present-day Gurdaspur district of Punjab.<br><br>

                                      In 1793, due to growing internal disputes in his state, Raja Sahib Singh summoned his sister Bibi Sahib Kaur to Patiala and appointed her as the prime minister. Shortly after her arrival in Patiala, she had to return to Fatehgarh with a large Patiala army to rescue her husband, who had been captured by Fateh Singh, a rival chief. Upon returning to Patiala, Bibi Sahib Kaur faced a significant Maratha force marching towards the town in 1794, commanded by Anta Rao and Lachhman Rao.<br><br>
                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                    
                                      Raja Bhag Singh of Jind, Jodh Singh of Kalsia, and Bhanga Singh of Thanesar united with Bibi Sahib Kaur, while Tara Singh Ghaiba sent a troop of soldiers to support her. The combined force, consisting of around 7,000 men, confronted the enemy at Mardanpur near Ambala, where a fierce battle ensued. Despite being greatly outnumbered, the Sikhs were determined to fight until Sahib Kaur, dismounting from her chariot, drew her sword and urged them to stand firm in their positions. The following morning, they launched a surprise attack on the Maratha army, who were caught off guard and fled towards Karnal in complete disarray.<br><br>

                                      Bibi Sahib Kaur was a skilled warrior and leader who played a significant role in the history of the Sutlej states from 1793 to 1801. She was born in 1771 and was the elder sister of Raja Sahib Singh of Patiala. At a young age, she was married to Jaimal Singh of the Kanhaiya clan. In 1793, due to increasing dissensions within the state, her brother recalled her to Patiala and appointed her as the prime minister. However, she had to return to Fatehgarh, her husband's residence, to rescue him from being captured by Fateh Singh, a rival chief.<br><br>
                                      
                                    </p>
                       
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      When a large Maratha force marched towards Patiala in 1794, Sahib Kaur joined forces with Raja Bhag Singh of Jind, Jodh Singh of Kalsia, and Bhanga Singh of Thanesar, along with a detachment of troops from Tara Singh Ghaiba, to face the enemy at Mardanpur near Ambala. Despite being outnumbered, the Sikh force fought fiercely and won the battle.<br><br>

                                      In 1796, Sahib Kaur led a strong force to the hills in response to the request of the Raja of Nahan, who had sought help from Raja Sahib Singh of Patiala to quell a revolt in his state. She successfully restored peace in the area, and the grateful Raja presented her with valuable gifts.<br><br>

                                      In 1799, Sahib Kaur came to the aid of Jind when it was besieged by English adventurer George Thomas. With the help of other Sikh chiefs, she forced Thomas to withdraw.<br><br>

                                      Due to differences with her brother, Sahib Kaur had to leave Patiala and settle in Bherlan, where she built a fort and renamed the village Ubheval. She died there in 1801.<br><br>

                                      fter the death of Maharaja Alla Singh, his grandson Maharaja Amar Singh became the ruler of Patiala. He proved to be intelligent and brave, and extended his rule up to the river Jamuna. His subjects trusted and respected him, and he, in turn, was considerate of them. This trust and closeness between the ruler and his subjects led to increased progress and it was expected that Maharaja Amar Singh's rule would continue to extend the boundaries of his rule.<br><br>

                                      Unfortunately, as humans, we often make plans while our Creator has a different plan in store for us. At the height of Patiala rule, the young Maharaja suddenly passed away, replacing all joy with sadness, hope with despair, and positivity with negativity. The future of Patiala seemed to be hanging on the edge of major difficulties and facing numerous dangers. Maharaja Amar Singh's death came unexpectedly during his youth, leaving behind two princes and a princess. The heroine of our story is this princess, Rani Sahib Kaur, who was the eldest among her siblings at 15 years old at the time of her father's death. Maharaja Sahib Singh, seven years younger than her, inherited the throne. However, he was only a nominal ruler. The real power was in the hands of Diwan Nanu Mal, who was the most trusted advisor during Maharaja Amar Singh's reign. Unfortunately, after the Maharaja's death, Diwan's loyalty quickly evaporated and was replaced by selfishness. He aligned with the Marathas and initiated efforts to destroy the Patiala rule from its roots. Diwan's attitude also influenced the other servants of the empire, who began to pursue their selfish gains, leading to corruption, looting, and injustice within the empire. Justice and peace fled like a bird. The empire was in immediate danger, with the inner situation fast deteriorating, and external enemies eager to destroy it. The child Maharaja Sahib Singh was terrified of the emerging situation.<br><br>

                                      
                                      
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      Meanwhile, Bibi Sahib Kaur had been married and was living happily with her in-laws. No woman wants to leave her home, yet Sahib Kaur took immediate action upon learning of the situation in her brother's empire. Her love for her younger brother drove her to set aside her own happily married life and immediately proceed to protect the Patiala rule.<br><br>

                                      Operating a functioning machine is not a difficult task, but it requires a skilled mechanic to operate a machine whose crucial parts have seriously deteriorated. This was the state of Patiala. However, Rani Sahib Kaur, who was known as the daughter of Khalsa, was undeterred. She skillfully fixed the broken machinery and attempted to operate it.<br><br>

                                      Gradually, the situation began to improve. Although it had significantly improved, it hadn't fully recovered when a mob of Maratha soldiers advanced to conquer Patiala. The renowned commander of the Maratha forces was Lakshami Rao, who commanded a force of 100,000 men. The news of the impending attack also reached Rani Sahib Kaur. The rulers of Jind and Kaethal had already accepted the Marathas' conditions and paid a large sum for their safety. This made the situation even more dire for Patiala.<br><br>

                                      The Marathas were swiftly approaching Patiala. Their success with Jind and Kaethal had greatly boosted their confidence. On the other hand, Patiala's internal situation had not fully recovered. In everyone's estimation, Patiala's forces were incapable of defending themselves against the Marathas. Bahadhur Sahib Kaur was well aware of this assessment, but she neither flinched nor lost her confidence. In such circumstances, even the bravest men could lose their courage, but this courageous daughter of the Khalsa remained undeterred. Her composure remained unchanged, as if she did not know the concept of failure. She was not discouraged. She had partaken in Guru's amrit, which can give a lease of new life even to the dead. It can instill a courageous spirit in birds to defeat hawks. Then why should she be afraid? Fear could not even approach her.<br><br>

                                      She commanded the beating of the war drums, Nagara, and made preparations to confront the invading forces. In the darkness of the night, she called upon and assembled Bhai Bangha Singh Thanaesar, Jodh Singh Kalsia, Deep Singh and Bir Singh Bhadodhiae, Tara Singh Ghaeba, and other Chiefs of the neighboring territories. Even before the sunrise, the sky resounded with the Khalsa's battle cry "Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal," as the Sikhs advanced to confront the invading forces with the tips of their swords. Before reaching Kuch, she addressed a small group of selected associates. In a sweet yet firm voice, she said, "Brothers, the enemy is advancing, thinking of you as few and weak, to snatch your freedom. Our freedom is a blessed reward of our Guru Sahibans. Our Tenth Pathshah addressed this rule as 'your home is same as my home.' This is the rule of the Guru and his GurSikhs. It is your freedom as well as your honor. Could you tolerate Maratha feet reaching here to crush your freedom and honor?" Every soldier collectively responded, "Never, Never!"<br><br>
                                      
                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      Continuing her speech, she said, "My brothers, this is what I expected from you. You are Sikhs of the Guru, and I am confident that you will not allow the enemy to advance any further. The only remaining issue is that of numbers. But remember, our Tenth Guru engaged 150,000 against each Sikh. You are Sikhs of the same Guru. Thus, don't worry about the huge numbers of the enemy force. We are within our rights and following the truth. We are raising our swords in defense of our freedom. Guru is with us. Recognize your duty and responsibilities. The victory is yours. Take an oath with me that we shall die but not allow the enemy to advance even a foot."<br><br>

                                      The entire force took their oath together. Then Bibi Sahib Kaur did her ardas, after which the skies resounded with the sounds of Jaikaras, "Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal," along with the beating of battle drums. Now the brave soldiers of Patiala advanced to defend their honor. While these few brave soldiers of Patiala left their capital, Ghanta Rao and Lakshami Rao left Ambala with their forces heading towards Patiala. Both sides clashed in the open fields of Mardaan Pur. Upon facing each other, it became clear that not only was the Marhata force larger in numbers, they also had heavy artillery and cannons.<br><br>

                                      In comparison, the Sikhs were few in number and did not possess any cannons. There was no match between the two sides. It was evident that the Sikhs would simply disappear facing the Marhatas, like salt when mixed with flour. The Marhata Sardars sent their envoy to convey a message, "why are you determined to get your men killed for nothing, give up and surrender." Upon hearing this message, Bibi Sahib Kaur's face reddened with anger. "Surrender," she repeated. Then addressing the Marhata envoy, she said, "Surrender! Guru's Sikhs know no surrender. Go tell your sardars that if they have any desire to live, they should return immediately. If not, Khalsa's sword awaits them. They may approach with their coffins."<br><br>

                                      The Marhata Sardars, feeling confident in their strength, became even more agitated upon hearing Bibi Sahib Kaur's response. They believed that winning over a few soldiers from Patiala would be an easy task for them. They signaled their cannons to begin shelling. A battle between swords and cannons? This was a unique event in the history of warfare, and it was clearly visible in the fields of Mardaan Pur. On one side, the Marhata cannons were blindly firing shells, while on the other side, Guru's brave soldiers were advancing with their swords. Bibi Sahib Kaur, dressed in male attire and riding on horseback, was directing her soldiers with an unsheathed sword.<br><br>

                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      The Sikh soldiers fearlessly advanced into the enemy's fortified positions. Now, the soldiers were directly facing each other, and the cannons became useless. The battle of swords ensued, and the Sikhs were renowned for their skills in using swords. For once, the Marhatas became scared upon witnessing the weakness of their soldiers. At this moment, Lakshami Rao advanced with fresh horsemen and attacked the Sikhs. The Sikhs too were in need of fresh reinforcements, but where could they get them? All their resources were tied up in the battle with none to spare.<br><br>

                                      The battle raged on throughout the day, with the advantage sometimes favoring the Sikhs and sometimes the Marhatas. The battlefield was strewn with corpses and the ground was soaked in blood. The Sun God was unable to bear witness to this bloody battle and retreated behind a hill. At this point, the situation for the Sikhs was dire. They were surrounded by the enemy and there appeared to be no visible escape route. However, Bibi Sahib Kaur's courage proved to be critical. She identified a weak spot in the enemy's siege and boldly attacked it, shouting the Jaikara, "Jo Bole So Nihal, Sat Sri Akal."<br><br>

                                      Her bravery and the Jaikara revitalized the Sikh soldiers and they successfully broke through the enemy's siege using their swords. Ghanta Rao and Lakshami Rao were left astonished as their well-planned scheme crumbled before their eyes. Nightfall had set in and the soldiers could no longer see each other, so both sides retreated to their camps for rest. Celebrations could be heard in the Marhata camps, while mourning was prevalent in the Sikh camps due to the heavy casualties they had suffered. The Sikh Sardars and soldiers were disheartened, but Bibi Sahib Kaur remained calm and serious, as if lost in deep thought.<br><br>
                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      A selected group of Sikh Sardars gathered in Bibi Sahib Kaur's tent to assess the day's battle. It was determined that more than half of the Sikh force had been wiped out. Sardar Jodh Singh asked, "Bibi Ji! Tell us what to do now?" Bibi Ji responded in a slow and soft voice, as if trying to probe the inner thoughts of the Sardars. After all, the Sardars had collectively come to her with some apparent consensus. Jodh Singh did not respond, but Dalip Singh Bhadodhiae said, "Bibi Ji! The status of the battle is clear. There is no hope for any type of victory. The time to give our lives is upon us. Although, Guru's Sikhs aren't afraid of this but ." He couldn't complete his sentence when he was interrupted by Bibi Ji's question, "But what?" Silence prevailed. For a long time, no one responded.<br><br>

                                      Seeing no answer, she repeated her question "Brothers! Tell me what we should do now?" "Bibi Ji! What can we do? We will fight bravely. We shall fight in the face of sure death. We shall happily accept our death. It is true that we have no hope of victory. But a Sikh's duty is to fight. We shall fight, for we cannot witness any encroachment of Patiala's freedom or honor while living. However, we have a serious request of you, that you should return to Patiala. The battlefield isn't in our control, and we cannot risk your capture by the enemy forces," Bhai Bangha Singh Thanaesar hesitatingly uttered this response.<br><br>

                                      Upon hearing this, Bibi Sahib Kaur became angry at the suggestion that she would prioritize her personal life over the freedom and honor of Patiala. She reminded the Sardars that she too had taken the amrit of the same Guru and was prepared to face death. She refused to leave the battlefield without victory, and her words moved the Sardars to silence and deep thought. She expressed confidence in their cause and reminded them that they were fighting for truth and righteousness, and that VaahGuru was with them.<br><br>

                                      As Bibi Ji stood up and began pacing around the tent, it was clear that she was about to make a major decision.<br><br>
                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      Bibi Sahib Kaur's face soon lit up with happiness, as if she was convinced of her victory. Addressing her Sardars, she said, "Guru Sahib has shown me the way to our victory. What we need now is your courage." Everyone's attention was now focused on Bibi's face. They replied in unison, "We are prepared to follow your orders." Bibi said, "Look! Strength itself is not enough to win a battle. In fact, the understanding and deployment of strategy is more beneficial. We too can defeat the Maratha forces with strategy." "Tell us what to do," everyone responded collectively.<br><br>

                                      "At this moment, the enemy forces are celebrating their victory. As such, they are careless in their egoistic happiness. If we were to suddenly attack them now, our victory is assured, and the freedom and honor of Patiala can be preserved." All Sardars were astonished. They didn't know that Sahib Kaur was equally sharp in battle strategy. This decision was taken around 10:30 pm. Until midnight, all battle preparations were carried out quietly. This decision invigorated new courage among the Sikh forces. Soldiers started coming out of their tents after preparing themselves for the battle.<br><br>

                                      Bibi Sahib Kaur, now dressed in male attire and riding horseback with unsheathed sword, faced her soldiers and gave a short speech, "Brothers! The time has come for either victory or death in this battle for preserving the freedom and honor of Patiala. Advance, keeping faith in Guru. Victory shall be yours. Your swords shall be the death message for the egoistic Marathas. Prove the strength of our Tenth Guru's Amrit."<br><br>

                                      After the Sikh forces' surprise attack, the enemy was taken aback and many soldiers were killed within minutes. The darkness and suddenness of the attack caused confusion, and many enemy soldiers ended up fighting and killing each other. Bibi Sahib Kaur actively participated in the battle, encouraging her soldiers with Jaikaras and killing enemy soldiers with her sword. The attack completely turned the tables, with the Sikhs emerging victorious and the Marhatas defeated. Ghanta Rao and Lakshami Rao fled towards Hisar with their remaining companions upon seeing Bibi Sahib Kaur's sword.<br><br>

                                      When the sun rose, the extent of the Marhata defeat became clear. Countless enemy soldiers lay dead, and the Sikh forces had gained control of the battlefield. They also seized enemy cannons, ammunition, ration, and treasury, which Bibi Sahib Kaur distributed among her soldiers. She then took the cannons and ammunition to Patiala, where she was welcomed with great celebration for her bravery and success in saving the freedom and honor of Patiala.<br><br>

                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      Bibi Sahib Kaur's courage and battle strategy instilled fear in the Marhatas, and they never dared to advance towards Punjab again. Her name is now engraved in the fine pages of Sikh history, demonstrating the capability and strength of GurSikh women. No one can say that they are weaker compared to their male counterparts. Bibi Sahib Kaur's sword became a symbol of terror for the Marhatas.<br><br>

                                      Sahib Kaur was an exceptional leader and diplomat, belonging to the royal family of the Patiala state, which was ruled by a Sikh leader. Patiala, now a district headquarters in the state of Punjab, was her birthplace in 1773 to her parents, Amar Singh and Raj Kaur. She was also known as Rani, which means queen. She was known for her beauty, extraordinary intelligence, and brilliance. She was able to read and write Punjabi and had received training in horse riding and the use of arms since childhood. She was baptized in 1779 and became a Singhni. During those times, early marriage was a common practice, and she was married to S. Jaimal Singh, son of S. Haqiqat Singh of Kanehia Misal (group), in 1780 with great pomp and show. It is said that her marriage party consisted of twenty thousand members.<br><br>

                                      Her younger brother, Sahib Singh, became the ruler of the state at the age of six after their father's death in 1781. Historians describe him as a coward, lazy, and foolish person. During his minority, his grandmother Rani Hukman and his clever prime minister, Nanu Mal, saved the state from disintegration. The state was in complete chaos, and there were intrigues all around against both of them. After the death of Rani Hukman, the state faced a terrible shock that could have wrecked it. The subordinate chiefs of Patiala began to declare independence, and Sahib Singh dismissed Nanu Mal and took control of the state in his own hands but failed to control the palace intrigues.<br><br>

                                      In 1791, Sahib Singh, the ruler of Patiala, invited his sister Sahib Kaur to become his prime minister. She was living with her husband in Gardaspur at the time. She accepted the position, but only on the condition that no one would interfere with her duties and that she would have the freedom to choose her own assistants. As events would later prove, she was an excellent administrator, a courageous military leader, and an intelligent diplomat. She managed her affairs in the office and on the battlefield with great success. She possessed all of the qualities traditionally associated with masculinity, such as bravery, perseverance, and sagacity, without any trace of what might be considered feminine weakness. She appointed S. Tara Singh as her deputy and removed corrupt officials from their positions. She used her iron hand to bring subordinate chiefs into line and collect taxes owed to the state. She also oversaw the construction of two new forts and toured the state to stay in touch with her subjects.<br><br>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      Sahib Kaur later learned that her cousin had imprisoned her husband. Without delay, she gathered a strong force and rushed to his aid. After launching a sudden and forceful attack, she not only liberated her husband, but also recovered the property that had been in dispute and returned to Patiala in triumph.<br><br>

                                      As the Mughal kingdom in Delhi was falling apart, the Marathas were advancing from the west. Nano Rao, a Maratha chief, wanted to subordinate the Patiala state and sent agents to demand tribute. Sahib Kaur won over the agents and sent them back to report that the Sikh chiefs were too powerful to be challenged. However, Nano Rao planned to attack anyway. Sahib Kaur called a meeting of the Sikh rulers of Jind, Nabha, and Kalsian states to discuss the matter. They were initially reluctant to fight, but Sahib Kaur convinced them to unite and face the Marathas together. She sent a strong reply to the Marathas and warned them that if they advanced, she would meet them on the battlefield. With an army of seven thousand, Sahib Kaur left Patiala to confront the enemy. Before departing, she addressed her chiefs and soldiers, saying, "I have taken a pledge that I will not return without defeating the enemy. Would you tolerate a young lady being killed while fighting and leave the battlefield in disgrace?" She stood before them with a naked sword, preparing them mentally for the coming battle. Her speech and display of heroism inspired and emboldened her soldiers and chiefs.<br><br>

                                      In 1791, Sahib Singh appointed his sister, Sahib Kaur, as his prime minister and gave her full authority over the affairs of the state, including the selection of her own assistants. She proved to be an excellent administrator, a fearless general, and an astute diplomat who possessed all the qualities of a true leader. Sahib Kaur appointed S. Tara Singh as her deputy and dismissed corrupt officials, subordinated chiefs who did not pay their tribute, and collected the due taxes. She also constructed two new forts and toured the state to stay connected with the people. When she learned that her cousin had imprisoned her husband, she quickly led a strong force to rescue him, and not only freed him but also regained his property that was under dispute.<br><br>

                                      As the Maratha kingdom in western India began to expand, Nano Rao, a Maratha chief, demanded tribute from the Patiala state. However, Sahib Kaur won over his agents, who reported back to him that the Sikh chiefs were too powerful to be challenged. Despite this warning, Nano Rao planned to attack the Patiala state. Sahib Kaur called a meeting of the Sikh rulers of Jind, Nabha, and Kalsian states for consultation. Although they were initially hesitant to fight, Sahib Kaur convinced them to unite against the Marathas. She sent a strong reply to Nano Rao, warning him that if he advanced, she would meet him on the battlefield. Sahib Kaur led an army of seven thousand soldiers to face the enemy, and in the fierce battle of Mardanpur, the Sikh forces lost one-third of their army while the enemy lost half of their men. Sahib Kaur personally fought in the battle and killed Ranjit Rao, a brave Maratha chief, in a one-on-one fight. The fight continued till evening, when the soldiers retired to their camps. Sahib Kaur and her chiefs met at night and planned for the next day. They decided to launch a surprise attack on the Marathas at midnight, and the enemy was taken off guard and fled the battlefield.<br><br>

                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      In 1796, during the great Kumbh Fair at Hardwar, a dispute arose between two groups of saints - the Gosains and the Udasis. Sahib Singh, who was camping nearby with his followers, supported the Udasis. When Sahib Kaur heard about the dispute, she rushed to the scene with reinforcements and resolved the situation. Similarly, when the ruler of Nahan, a neighboring hilly state, sought the help of the Patiala state in controlling internal disturbances in his kingdom, Sahib Kaur led a force of one thousand soldiers to restore peace. The ruler of Nahan was grateful to Sahib Kaur and presented her with a tall and strong elephant that she kept for her own use.<br><br>

                                      George Thomas, an Irish adventurer, had established his own independent state at Hansi, which is now located in Haryana state. He was eager to expand his territory and therefore attacked Bhag Singh, the ruler of Jind state, and laid siege to Jind. Bhag Singh sought the help of other Sikh rulers and chiefs. While Sahib Singh employed delaying tactics, Sahib Kaur, a woman of exceptional bravery and spirit, put pressure on him to assist. However, Sahib Singh refused and prohibited Sahib Kaur from going for help. She retorted that if Jind fell, Patiala would not be safe for long. Sahib Kaur gathered troops and left Patiala without her brother's approval. Along the way, several other Sikh chiefs joined her cause.<br><br>

                                      Thomas opposed the Sikhs with heavy artillery fire, and they were forced to retreat. In early 1799, Sahib Kaur commanded a force of nine thousand Sikh troops and attacked Thomas' strongholds. She cut off his supply lines and her bravery inspired others to join her cause. After a blockade of one hundred days, Thomas withdrew from Jind and hastily retreated. The Sikh forces pursued him, but they had to retreat when Thomas attacked them while they were sleeping. When they returned to Jind, Sahib Kaur scolded and taunted them for their cowardice. She stated that she would personally lead the charge and show them how to fight. They felt ashamed and vowed to conquer or die trying.<br><br>

                                      The Sikhs attacked Thomas once again, and he offered peace terms that each party would remain in possession of its territories held before the siege of Jind. All Sikh chiefs except Sahib Singh favored accepting the terms. Sahib Kaur attempted to convince her brother to accept the peace terms as a wise politician would, but he was a stubborn man who refused to agree. Therefore, Sahib Kaur signed the treaty on behalf of the Patiala state, which enraged Sahib Singh. Additionally, his wife instigated him against Sahib Kaur.<br><br>

                                      Sahib Kaur's fate took a tragic turn after the Jind siege. Sahib Singh, being a cruel and vindictive person, arrested his own sister and imprisoned her in Patiala. Sahib Kaur sought help from George Thomas, who fought his way through Patiala forces to rescue her. However, Sahib Singh eventually gave in and released his sister. But his revengeful nature led him to imprison her again in the fort of Patiala. Sahib Kaur managed to escape but was recaptured and imprisoned once more. It is believed that she was murdered in 1779, while still in the prime of her life. This was a tragic end to the life of the Joan of Arc of the Patiala state.<br><br>

                                      
                                    </p>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                      Sahib Kaur's role in Sikh history was remarkable. She displayed exceptional character, bravery, and statesmanship, which earned her a place of distinction in Sikh history. Had she lived in independent India, she would have made an excellent Prime Minister. George Thomas even referred to her as a man due to her extraordinary courage. According to Bhai Kahn Singh, the author of Mahan Kosh, she made unparalleled efforts to protect and expand her brother's state. Mohammad Latif, a renowned Muslim historian, acknowledged that the Maratha defeat was partly due to Sahib Kaur's leadership on the battlefield, inspiring her troops to fight fiercely. There is no doubt that without the help of her brave and selfless sister, Sahib Singh would not have survived as the ruler of Patiala. Sahib Kaur's life serves as a guiding light for generations to come.<br><br>

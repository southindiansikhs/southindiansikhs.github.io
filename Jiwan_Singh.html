                                    <h1 >BABA JIVAN SINGH JI</h1>

                                      Bhai Jivan Singh, born on 13th December 1649, was a Sikh from Patna, India, who belonged to the Majhabi caste, considered a scavenger community. He was later renamed by Guru Gobind Singh Ji as Bhai Jivan Singh on 14th April 1699, the day when the Khalsa was established and he received the rites of initiation from the Guru.
 
                                    </p>

                                    
                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">

                                      Bhai Jivan Singh was bestowed with the special honor of being called "Ranghareta Guru Ka Beta" by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, who later initiated him into the Khalsa Panth. The Ranghar caste was created for those who were born of a union between a Hindu and a Muslim, and both they and their descendants were considered outcasts by the Hindus.<br><br>

                                      Bhai Jaita, as he was previously known, risked his life to recover and return the severed head of Guru Tegh Bahadur Singh Ji to the Guru for cremation. He was sent to Delhi where he witnessed the beheading of Guru Tegh Bahadur Singh Ji in Chandni Chowk on 24th November 1675. Despite the danger, he managed to evade the guards and escape with the severed head of the ninth Guru to Anandpur, where he was received with great honor by Guru Gobind Singh Ji.<br><br>

                                      In the ensuing chaos, others were able to secure and cremate the Guru's body, although they had to burn down their own home to accomplish this.<br><br>

                                    <h3>BHAI JAITA'S SUMMARY</h3>

                                    <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                  
                                      Bhai Jaita was born on 13th December 1649 to parents Sada Chand and Premo (also known as Kanno). He was initially named Jag Chand but Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib renamed him to Jaita at some point.<br><br>

                                      Bhai Jaita and his younger brother Bhag Chand, also known as Bhagu, were disciples of Guru Har Rai, the seventh Nanak from Kiratpur, located in the Sivalik hills where the Guru resided at that time. Later, they moved with their parents to the village of Jhanda Ramdas, where they lived with Bhai Gurditta, the great-great-grandson of Bhai Buddha.<br><br>
                                      
                                      After Bhai Gurditta was arrested in Delhi following the detention of Guru Tegh Bahadur, Jaita was sent by the family to bring news of him. He then lived in Anandpur and became the first beater of the Guru Gobind Singh's Ranjit Nagara, a large drum played during Sikh processions.<br><br>
                                      
                                      Bhai Jaita was the first drummer of the Ranjit Nagara and trained the Sahibzadas in the art of warfare. He was also a marksman and trained the two elder sons of Guru Gobind Singh himself in the same skill. He participated in all of Guru Gobind Singh's battles against the hill chiefs and the Mughals.<br><br>
                                      
                                      In 1691, Bhai Jaita got married to Raj Kaur, the daughter of Sujan Singh from the village of Riar near Amritsar. They had four sons together.<br><br>

                                      Bhai Jivan Singh, as he was later known, fell as a martyr in the Battle of Chamkaur on 8th December 1705. A Gurdwara called Gurdwara-Shahid-Burj now stands on the site as a monument to his memory.<br><br>

                               <h3>CHILDHOOD</h3>

                            

                                <p style="text-align: justify;">

                                  Bhai Jaita was born on December 13, 1649 in Patna Sahib to Bhai Sada Nand and Mata Premo. His birth took place at 1:13 A.M. on the 7th moon day of Poh Bikrami Samat, 1718, which fell on Tuesday. Although he was named Jag Chand at birth, Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib himself gave him the name 'Jaita'. In December 1665, Guru Tegh Bahadur went on his third missionary tour of the eastern parts and took Bhai Sada Nand Ji and his family with him. While he left his wife Mata Gujari Ji and other female members of the family at Patna under the supervision of Bhai Kirpal Chand Ji, the brother of Mata Gujari Ji, Guru Ji left for the Bengal area. During this time, Gobind Rai Ji, Guru Ji's only son, was born on December 22, 1666, at the same place where they were staying. The following day, Bhai Sangata, the second son of Bhai Sada Nand Ji, was born. In the middle of 1670, Guru Tegh Bahadur reached Anandpur Sahib while carrying on his missionary propagation. However, Mata Ji and Sahibzada Gobind Rai Ji stayed back at Patna Sahib.<br><br>

                                  During their childhood in Patna, Bhai Jaita and his younger brother Bhai Sangata were fortunate enough to play in the company of Gobind Rai Ji. Once, while playing on the bank of the Ganges, their return home was delayed a little. In a hurry, Jaita started tying the turban of young Gobind Rai Ji on his own head. Realizing his mistake, Bhai Jaita Ji returned the turban to Gobind Rai Ji, who said, "Jaite, the time for you to tie my turban has not yet come. When the time comes, I will myself put my turban on your head."<br><br>
                                  
                                 
                                </p>

                                
                                
                                <h3> FAMILY BACKGROUND</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  Before becoming the Ninth Guru, Guru Tegh Bahadur spent ten years meditating in a basement from 1644-1664 A.D. in Baba Bakala, where Bhai Sada Nand Ji attended him. Bhai Sada Nand Ji's name is mentioned in the Hukamnamahs (official orders) of Guru Tegh Bahadur, which indicates his position in the Guru's establishment.<br><br>

                                  Bhai Sada Nand Ji was the son of Bhai Jas Bhan, the grandson of Bhai Sukh Bhan, and the great-grandson of Bhai Kalyana Ji, who founded the village of Kathu Nangal. Baba Buddha Ji also lived in Kathu Nangal and was a contemporary of Bhai Kalyana Ji. Bhai Kalyana Ji and Baba Buddha Ji later moved to Gaggo Mahal and then to Ramdas in the Amritsar district.<br><br>
                                  
                                  Bhai Kalyana Ji and his family served the Guru's establishment from the first Guru to the sixth Guru. They participated in voluntary service (Kar Seva) at Darbar Sahib and carried out tasks under the orders of Guru Arjan Sahib Ji, such as bringing timber from Mandi State. The family's respectable position in the Guru's establishment can be seen from the fact that Bhai Kalyana Ji's name is mentioned in the Hukamnamahs of Guru Har Gobind Sahib Ji.<br><br>
                                  
                                  Bhai Sukh Bhan Ji built Kalyan Ashram in the Mohlla Dilwali of the village Raisinha near Delhi, named after his father Bhai Kalyana Ji. He established a school of Gurmat Music at this Ashram, where hymn-singing of Gurbani was taught. Later on, this Ashram became known as Bhai Kalyana di Dharamashal, which was a center of Sikh activities. Bhai Agya Ram Ji, the elder uncle of Bhai Jaita, also resided in this Dharamshal.<br><br>
                                  
                                  Although some members of this family continued to reside in Kathu Nagal, Gaggo Mahal, and Ramdas in the Amritsar district, Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Ji often stayed at Bhai Kalyana's Dharamshal during his visits to Delhi. Bhai Sukh Bhan, Bhai Jas Bhan, Bhai Agya Ram, and Bhai Sada Nand continued to serve the Guru's establishment like their ancestors. They were great scholars, musicians, and excellent singers of their time.<br><br>

                                  
                                </p>

                                <h3>  RANGHRETE GURU KE BETE (SON OF GURU)</h3>


                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  In 1675 A.D., a deputation of Kashmiri Pandits led by Padit Kirpa Ram approached Guru Ji at Anandpur Sahib, petitioning for his help against the orthodox attitude of Aurangzeb. Hearing their distressing story, Guru Ji was lost in deep thought. Upon returning from his play, young Gobind Rai Ji asked his father why he seemed so worried. He then suggested that he offer himself for martyrdom in order to protect the Hindu religion.<br><br>

                                  On July 20, 1675 A.D., Guru Ji left Anandpur Sahib with his five loved ones. However, on September 15, 1675 A.D., they were arrested in Agra and imprisoned in Delhi. Bhai Jaita Ji managed to escape from prison with the help of Aurangzeb's daughter Zebunnissa, Kotwal Khwaja Abdullah, and his uncle Bhai Agya Ram. He then reached Anandpur Sahib with anointing material for the guruship and the Ninth Master's Hukamnamahs. In addition, he brought with him 57 verses written by Guru Ji during his time in jail.<br><br>

                                  Baba Jiwan Singh Ji, also known as Bhai Jaita Ji, made a significant contribution to the Sikh Path. He handed over some important material to young Gobind Rai Ji at Anandpur Sahib, which later became part of the Guru Granth Sahib Ji. When Guru Gobind Singh Ji edited the Guru Granth Sahib Ji at Damdama Sahib, he included the verses of Guru Tegh Bahadur Ji that had been preserved by Bhai Jaita Ji in the rag Jaijaiwanti.<br><br>

                                  Bhai Jaita Ji also played a crucial role in the aftermath of Guru Tegh Bahadur Sahib Ji's martyrdom in Delhi. During an open session of the congregation, young Gobind Rai Ji requested a brave person to come forward and take responsibility for bringing back his father's head and trunk. Bhai Jaita Ji volunteered for the task and traveled to Delhi in disguise, staying at his uncle's house in Raisinha village. Bhai Sada Nand Ji was already there, keeping an eye on the situation in Delhi. Together, they made a plan to retrieve Guru Ji's head and trunk after his martyrdom. The Sikh Path remains indebted to Bhai Jaita Ji for his bravery and contributions.<br><br>

                                  In the early morning of November 11, 1675, while in a trance under a banyan tree, Guru Ji was martyred with a sword by the executioner Jalalludin of Samana, in accordance with the verdict pronounced by Qazi Abdul Wahab. The government had announced a death sentence for anyone attempting to carry away the head and trunk of the Guru Ji, which resulted in no devotees showing the courage to do so, and instead, they avoided being called the Sikhs of the Guru Ji.<br><br>

                                  During the first quarter of the night, Bhai Jaita Ji, along with his father Bhai Sada Nand Ji, his uncle Bhai Agya Ram Ji, and Oodai Singh Ji, managed to approach Guru Ji's dead body, taking cover in the pitch-darkness, taking advantage of the torrential rains and creeping near the walls of residential houses. According to the pre-devised plan, Bhai Jaita Ji severed the head of Bhai Sada Nand Ji so that his trunk and head could be exchanged with those of the Guru Ji.<br><br>

                                  Baba Jiwan Singh Ji himself testifies to this on page 35 of his sacred book "Sri Gur Katha" in the following manner:<br><br>

                                  
                          

                                  The entire plan was successfully carried out,<br><br>
                                  He replaced his father's head with that of the Guru Ji's,<br><br>
                                  It resembled the appearance of the Guru Ji,<br><br>
                                  All the courtiers acknowledged this,<br><br>
                                  Just as you have protected me from the enemy forces,<br><br>
                                  O Guru, please save me from going to hell,<br><br>
                                  The face of the Guru Ji was shown to all the Sikhs,<br><br>
                                  If someone speaks of dying for love,<br><br>
                                  Let him show love like my father did,<br><br>
                                  He had his own head severed,<br><br>
                                  And placed it at the feet of the Guru,<br><br>
                                  Thus he demonstrated his love.<br><br>

                                  Bhai Jaita Ji, along with his uncle Bhai Agya Ram Ji and Bhai Oodai Ji, quickly took Guru Ji's head and trunk and replaced them with the head and trunk of Bhai Sada Nand Ji. They then disappeared quietly with Guru Ji's remains and cremated his body by setting up a pyre within Bhai Agya Ram Ji's house at Bhai Kaliana's Dharamshal in Raisinha village near Delhi. The Kotwal of Chandni Chowk, Khwaja Abdullah, and Aurangzeb's daughter Zebunnisa helped them in this task. Later, when Emperor Aurangzeb discovered the cremation, he executed Bhai Agya Ram Ji and his family by torturing them to death. However, it is not known what happened to Pandit Shiv Narain Ji's family. Aurangzeb seized the site of Bhai Agya Ram's house and constructed a mosque there. Jathedar Baghel Singh later demolished the mosque and erected a Gurdwara named Rakab Ganj Sahib in its place.<br><br>

                                  After cremating Guru Ji's trunk at his uncle's house, Bhai Jaita took his head and travelled through Bagpat, Taraori, Ambala, Nabha, and other places before reaching Kiratpur Sahib on 15 November, 1675 A.D. According to the wishes of the members of Guru Ji's family, his head was placed in a palanquin and carried on Bhai Jaita's head in a procession to Anandpur Sahib. There, it was respectfully cremated in accordance with the customs of the Guru's establishment. The place of the cremation is now home to Gurudwara Sis Ganj Sahib.<br><br>

                                  Upon the arrival of Bhai Jaita Ji with the Guru Ji's head, the young Gobind Rai embraced him and honored him with the title of "Ranghrete Guru Ke Bete" (Son of Guru). Bhai Jaita Ji shared his experiences in Delhi, from the martyrdom of the 9th Master to the cremation of his trunk, and how the Sikh devotees were afraid to act. Guru Ji vowed to bring about significant changes in the Sikh community that would distinguish them from others, and fulfilled this vow by establishing the Khalsa on March 30, 1699 A.D. Bhai Jaita Ji requested a boon to be allowed to bathe in the holy tank of Shri Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar, and Guru Ji granted this request, also constructing a Bunga of Ranghretas near Dukh Bhanjni Beri where the Ranghreta Sikhs hold an annual fair.<br><br>

                                  Later, Aurangzeb learned about the assistance provided by Kotwal Khwaja Abdullah and Zebunnisa towards Guru Ji and the escape of Bhai Jaita Ji from jail, as well as the removal and cremation of Guru Ji's head and trunk. He had Zebunnisa slowly poisoned, but the Kotwal had already left his job in Delhi and sought protection from the Tenth Master in Anandpur Sahib.<br><br>

                                  Baba Jiwan Singh Ji stood by Guru Ji and demonstrated his bravery in various battles, including:<br><br>

                                        •	The Battle of Bhangani<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Nadaun<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Anandpur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Bajrur<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Nirmohgarh<br><br>
                                        •	The First Battle of Anandpur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	Sudden Attack on Anandpur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	Second Battle of Anandpur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	Third Battle of Anandpur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	Fourth Battle of Anandpur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Bansali/Kalmot<br><br>
                                        •	Sudden Attack - A Battle near Chamkaur Sahib<br><br>
                                        •	Freeing a Brahman Woman at Bassi Kalan<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Sirsa<br><br>
                                        •	The Battle of Chamkaur<br><br>

                                        In these battles, Baba Jiwan Singh Ji fearlessly fought alongside Guru Ji and played an important role in defending the Sikh faith against various enemies.<br><br>

                                During the Battle of Sirsa, Sahibzada Ajit Singh was surrounded by enemy forces. However, Baba Jiwan Singh came to his rescue, riding his horse and wielding two swords, with the reins of his horse in his mouth. He managed to fight off many enemies and successfully extricated Sahibzada Ajit Singh from the siege, unharmed.<br><br>

                                It is unlikely that there is any fighter in the world who could ride a horse, hold the reins in their mouth, and wield two swords at the same time. Similarly, no one has been born in the world who can shoot two rifles accurately at the same time, a skill that Baba Jiwan Singh possessed. During warfare, he always carried his two guns, Nagni and Baghni.<br><br>

                                Guru Ji introduced the war-drum, also known as Ranjit Nagara, to instill heroism in his soldiers during battle. The sound of the drum could be heard over a long distance, and Baba Jiwan Singh was the Chief Drummer responsible for its beating. The fighting always began with the beat of the drum.<br><br>

                                Baba Jiwan Singh was an expert in guerrilla warfare and was appointed by Guru Ji as the Chief of the Intelligence Department. Historical research indicates that he also served as the military trainer for Guru Ji's two eldest sons, Sahibzada Ajit Singh Ji and Sahibzada Jujhar Singh Ji.<br><br>

                                <h3>SRI GUR KATHA</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  Baba Jiwan Singh Ji was not only a skilled warrior, but also a talented poet. His work, "Sri Gur Katha," is a significant contribution to the Sikh religion. The book provides a first-hand account of Guru Ji's battles, and is filled with emotional and devoted praises of Guru Ji that place Baba Jiwan Singh Ji on par with the Bhatt Poets in Guru Granth Sahib. The book's depiction of Satguru Ji's personality is unparalleled and unique. It also describes in detail the incidents related to Amrit captivation, the preparation of Amrit, the significance of the five symbols in Sikhism, Sikh conduct and conventions, and the martyrdoms of Guru Teg Bahadur Ji and Bhai Sada Nand Ji (the father of Bhai Jiwan Singh Ji).<br><br>

                                  Baba Jiwan Singh Ji used various literary techniques such as Kabitt, Swaiyya, Dohira, Sarkhandi, Kundlia, Rala, Bisham Padi (Shabad), Chopayee, and Sortha to express his thoughts and emotions. He also employed alliteration, simile, metaphor, proverbs, examples, Weepsa Alankar, Utparokhia Alankar, and Ulek Alankar to convey his meanings. Baba Ji's writing is primarily focused on devotion, which emphasizes the essence of solace, but he also incorporates Pathos, Vir Ras, and Vibh Ras.<br><br>
                                  
                                  The style of a writer reflects their personality. Baba Jiwan Singh Ji's love for the Guru, courage, devotion, faith, forbearance, humility, enthusiasm, and other virtues all contributed to making his style unique.<br><br>
                                  
                                  
                                </p>

                                
                                <h3>AT CHAMKAUR SAHIB</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  On the night of December 22/23, 1704 A.D., Guru Gobind Singh Ji, along with 40 Singhs, including two of his older sons and the five original "Beloved Five" Panj Piyare, left Anandpur and reached Chamkaur di Garhi after crossing the flooded Sarsa rivulet and resting at Kot Nihang Khan. They sought permission from the city chief to seek shelter in their garhi or haveli for the night.<br><br>

                                  The Battle of Chamkaur Sahib was fought between the Khalsa, led by Guru Gobind Singh Ji, and the Mughal forces, led by Wazir Khan and other Mughal Generals.<br><br>
  
                                  
                                </p>

                                <h3> ENDOWED WITH THE PLUME AND RAIMENT</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  In the Battle of Chamkaur Sahib, Guru Gobind Singh Ji lost his two sons and 27 of his followers as martyrs. The remaining 11 Singhs in the fortress chose five of their loved ones to command Guru Ji to leave the fortress. Seeing this as a divine command, Guru Ji agreed and had to decide who to entrust his plume, weapons, dress, and appearance to. He chose Baba Jiwan Singh Ji (Bhai Jaita Ji), who was a devoted and perfect Gursikh, and bestowed upon him the title "Ranghreta Guru Ka Beta" and gifted him his Kalgi, Poshaka, and Weapon (Hatiar). Guru Ji did not give these invaluable articles to Bhai Sangat Singh (younger brother of Baba Jiwan Singh Ji) or Bhai Sant Singh.<br><br>
                                  
                                  During this time, Guru Ji offered Baba Jiwan Singh Ji anything he desired, but Baba Ji had no desires and did not ask for anything. Even when Guru Ji repeated his offer twice more, Baba Ji remained content and did not ask for anything. After three offers, Guru Ji said he was very happy with Baba Ji and wanted to give him something, but Baba Ji did not demand anything. Finally, Baba Jiwan Singh Ji told Guru Ji to give him whatever he liked. Guru Ji smiled and told him that his name would shine in the sky after 300 years, and now, after 300 years, he is rising again.<br><br>
                                  
                                  
                                </p>

                                <h3> MARTYRDOM OF BABA JIWAN SINGH JI (BHAI JAITA JI)</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  After Guru Ji left Chamkaur, the Mughal forces attacked the Garhi on the morning of December 23, 1704 A.D. There were only seven Singh soldiers left along with Baba Jiwan Singh Ji in the Havelli. Seven Singh soldiers went out on horses to fight while Baba Jiwan Singh Ji stayed inside and used two guns named Nagni and Baghni and arrows given by Guru Gobind Singh Ji to fight from the top of the Garhi. The Kalgi (Plume) of Guru Gobind Singh Ji shone on the head of Baba Jiwan Singh Ji, which made the Moguls believe that Guru Ji was still inside. This deception allowed Baba Jiwan Singh Ji to continue firing while beating the Nagaraa. The seven soldiers fought bravely against a force of 10 lac Mughal soldiers, and they were martyred one by one.<br><br>

                                  After the seven soldiers were martyred, Baba Jiwan Singh Ji fought alone with his swords in both hands. The Moguls thought that they were fighting against Guru Ji, who had come out of the Garhi because the Kalgi of Guru Ji was shining on the forehead of Baba Jiwan Singh Ji, which made their false thought true. Baba Jiwan Singh Ji broke out on the Moguls, who wanted to capture Guru Ji alive for rewards and high positions in the Mughal Royal Darbar.<br><br>

                                  After failing to catch Guru Gobind Singh Ji, the Mogul forces turned their attention to Baba Jiwan Singh Ji, who valiantly fought against them with two swords in his hands. However, the enemies were unable to capture him alive, and ultimately resorted to firing arrows and guns at him, causing him to bleed profusely and be martyred on 23 December 1704, as prophesied by Guru Ji when he said, "Sawa Lakh Se Ek Lraaun". Baba Jiwan Singh Ji was the last martyr of Chamkaur Sahib, and he fought bravely against a force of 10 lakh Mogul soldiers.<br><br>

                                  Upon Baba Jiwan Singh Ji's demise, the Mogul forces were overjoyed, with Wajid Khan and other warriors celebrating the supposed death of Guru Gobind Singh Ji. However, they were mistaken in their assumption that Baba Jiwan Singh Ji was the Guru, and instead separated his head from his body and presented it to the Mogul Emperor in Delhi. This mistake was later uncovered by Saltnat, the daughter of Aurangzeb, the Emperor of the Mughal Empire.<br><br>

                                  The responsibility of holding the funeral for the bodies of the Shaheed Singhs was entrusted to Mata Sharan Kaur Ji by Guru Gobind Singh Ji. Guru Ji instructed Mata Ji to hold a funeral for all of the Singh's bodies, with the exception of his elder son's body, which was to be given a separate funeral. When Bibi Ji asked how she could identify the Guru's elder son, he replied that his body had no head and he wore his poshaka.<br><br>

                                  
                                  
                                </p>

                                <h3> GURUDWARA SHAHEED BURJ SAHIB</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  The location where Baba Jiwan Singh Ji was martyred is now the site of Gurudwara Shaheed Burj Sahib, built in his memory. After Baba Jiwan Singh Ji's death, Bibi Sharan Kaur Ji organized his funeral at this site. Additionally, there is a historical well at this location where Guru Ji, his two sons, and other Singh soldiers drank water.

                                <h3> ACHIEVEMENTS</h3>

                                
                                <p style="text-align: justify;">
                                
                                  Baba Jiwan Singh Ji was a brave and courageous warrior who fought alongside Guru Gobind Singh Ji. He played a vital role in the Battle of Chamkaur Sahib, where he fought against a massive army of 10 lac Mogul soldiers. Despite being vastly outnumbered, Baba Jiwan Singh Ji showed incredible bravery and fought until his last breath.<br><br>

                                  During the battle, Baba Jiwan Singh Ji stayed inside the Garhi or Havelli and fired guns and arrows at the enemy soldiers. He even beat the Nagaraa and displayed incredible fighting skills. After running out of ammunition, Baba Jiwan Singh Ji came down from the Garhi holding swords in both hands and broke out on the Moguls, who thought that only Guru Gobind Singh Ji was alone inside.<br><br>
                                  
                                  Even though the enemies were unable to catch Baba Ji alive, they still fired arrows and guns at him, resulting in his martyrdom. Baba Jiwan Singh Ji's sacrifice and bravery in the face of overwhelming odds continue to inspire people to this day.<br><br>
                                  
                                  To honor his memory, Gurudwara Shaheed Burj Sahib was built at the place where he was martyred.<br><br>
